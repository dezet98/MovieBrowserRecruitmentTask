# Task comment

I have fulfilled all assumptions in the task. Although, I would have liked to show more of my advanced skills. That's why I decided not to improve the views that I find simple in Fluter, but to show more universal skills, such as:

* state management (use of bloc combined with freezed)
* error handling by functional programming (dartz)
* internationalization (intl, also basically linked to API, which has language support)
* add flutter_lints
* use in project basic animations, heroes, extensions
* add interceptors (for logging or adding API key)
* create some tests for business logic

Additionally, I added pagination to the movie list to further complicate the business logic and give the application significant functionality.

I also wanted to show how I deal with widgets, hence I added a clear button to the search widget so that there is at least one example StatefullWidget.
